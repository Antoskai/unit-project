Project Name: "Guess the Number - AI Edition"

Description: In this project, you will create a simple guessing game where the user thinks of a number between a given range, and the AI tries to guess that number by asking questions.

Instructions:

Step 1: Set Up the Game

1. Create a Python script (e.g., guess_the_number.py) to start the project.

2. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   import random
   import time
   ```

3. Set the range for the numbers that the user can think of (e.g., 1 to 100). You can define these as variables:
   ```python
   lower_bound = 1
   upper_bound = 100
   ```

4. Display a welcome message and instructions for the game:
   ```python
   print("Welcome to Guess the Number - AI Edition!")
   print("Think of a number between", lower_bound, "and", upper_bound)
   time.sleep(2)  # Pause for 2 seconds
   print("I will try to guess the number you are thinking of.")
   time.sleep(1)
   print("You only need to respond with 'H' if the guess is too high, 'L' if it's too low, and 'C' if I guessed correctly.")
   time.sleep(2)
   print("Let's get started!")
   ```

Step 2: Implement the AI's Guessing Logic

1. Create a function to generate the AI's guess:
   ```python
   def generate_guess(lower_bound, upper_bound):
       return random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)
   ```

2. Create a function to get the user's feedback on the AI's guess:
   ```python
   def get_user_feedback():
       user_response = input("Is the guess correct? (H/L/C): ").upper()
       while user_response not in ["H", "L", "C"]:
           print("Invalid input. Please enter 'H', 'L', or 'C'.")
           user_response = input("Is the guess correct? (H/L/C): ").upper()
       return user_response
   ```

3. Implement the main game loop:
   ```python
   def main():
       print("Think of a number between", lower_bound, "and", upper_bound)
       time.sleep(1)

       while True:
           guess = generate_guess(lower_bound, upper_bound)
           print("AI's guess:", guess)
           user_response = get_user_feedback()

           if user_response == "H":
               upper_bound = guess - 1
           elif user_response == "L":
               lower_bound = guess + 1
           else:  # user_response == "C"
               print("AI guessed correctly! The number was:", guess)
               break
   ```

Step 3: Run the Game

1. Add the following code at the end of the script to call the main function and start the game:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

2. Save and run the script using the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```

The game will begin, and the AI will try to guess the number the user is thinking of. The user will provide feedback, and the AI will continue guessing until it gets the correct number.

Enjoy your AI project and have fun guessing numbers with the AI! Feel free to customize the range or add more features to make it even more exciting!
